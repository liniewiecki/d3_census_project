ok, we need a plan.

0. initialize the project: git, idea
1. "Good artists copy, great artists steal": do a code review of a similar project on d3
2. in detail review of the existing code
3. what can I take from my past projects?
4. make a list of tasks
    just about:
        - d3
        - csv parsing
        - hover effects
        - how to interact with the css
        - small chart: which, where, effects
        - ...
